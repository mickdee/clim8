# clim8
### A browser-based CLI prototyping tool

#### What is clim8 for?
Clim8 simulates the interactions of a bash terminal in the web browser. Use it as a template to prototype CLI commands without actually building them first - or whatever else you might need a fake terminal in the browser for!

#### How do I use it?
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open index.html in a web browser and type 'clim8' + [enter] into the terminal prompt to explore the tool
3. Modify or add to the set of commands in script.js to fit the needs of your project

#### How is it built?
HTML + CSS + Javascript - no frameworks or dependencies required
